### Howdy!

My name is Shayne Tremblay, and I think of myself as a programmer, technologist, and a good citizen in training.

### A lil about me

I want to live in a world where software does more good than harm.

I enjoy fermented vegetables, rollerblading, communism, and many other things.

I'm excited about software architecture, language design, functional programming, static typing, resilient systems, and kinda anything under the software sun.
