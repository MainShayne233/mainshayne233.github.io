TL;DR: You can deploy your `create-elm-app` to Heroku as a static site with a small PHP shim and a neat git trick.

## The Situation

[create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) is a really cool tool that will bootstrap a fully functioning [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) app for you with a single command. Along with setting up the project, the tool also provides some handy-dandy commands for running a server, building a production version of the app, etc. Check out the [project's page](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) for more details.

I often reach for this tool when spiking out a standalone Elm app, and often find myself wanting to throw my app up on a server in order to share it. For these purposes, I typically lean on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) and their [free hobby tier](https://www.heroku.com/free).

I recently had a `create-elm-app` I wanted to deploy to Heroku, but couldn't find much regarding an easy way to do so. Most ecosystems have a decent [Heroku Buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks), and though some do exist for Elm, I was running into issues regarding new Elm versions, etc.

Since my app was purely a client-side application (no backend), I thought maybe I'd just try and deploy it as a static site. Luckily, there's a pretty simple method for deploying static sites to Heroku that involves a teensy-tiny PHP shim. More details can be found in the [blog post](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/deploy-static-site-heroku) where I disocvered this trick, but the basic idea is that you add a simple `index.php` file that will point to your main `index.html`, and as long as your static assets are pushed to the server, Heroku will serve your static site!

## How It's Done

Enough talk, let's deploy!

Starting from scratch, we will build a new `create-elm-app` and get it deployed to Heroku.

### Prerequisites

- [Install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
- [Install create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app#installation)
- [Sign up for Heroku](https://heroku.com)
- [Install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

(hopefully I'm not missing anything)

### Create a new app

In your directory of choice, use `create-elm-app` to, well, create an Elm app:

```sh
create-elm-app MyApp
cd MyApp
elm-app start
```

If all goes well, your browser should open to reveal your brand new Elm app!

(you may kill the server now; it's not necessary for the deployment)

### Setup app to be deployed

First things first, we're relying on `git` for our deployment, so we'll want to `git init` our new app:

```sh
# in ./MyApp
git init
git add -A
git commit -m 'Create new project using create-elm-app'
```

Now we'll use the Heroku CLI to create a new Heroku app to deploy to:

```sh
# in ./MyApp
# sign in if you haven't yet
heroku auth:login

# create new app
heroku create my-app-name
```

And now for the fun part!

I wrote a handy-dandy `bash` script that will build the app for the currently checked out branch and deploy the build to Heroku, no questions asked.

The script:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

##
# Given that you have a `heroku` remote added to your local repo, this will:
# - Get the current branch name
# - Check to see if the current branch is in a clean state
# - Force delete the deploy branch if it exists
# - Checkout a fresh deploy branch
# - Build a static version of the app
# - Create an index.php file to allow Heroku to serve the static site
# - Create a composer.json file to silence the Heroku warnings
# - Force add the build to git
# - Force push the build directory to Heroku
# - Checkout the original branch
# - Delete the deploy branch

main() {
  local current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  if ! [ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
    echo "The current branch (${current_branch}) isn't clean."
    echo "Commit or remove these changes and try again."
    exit 1
  fi
  git branch -D deploy >>/dev/null 2>&1
  git checkout -b deploy
  elm-app build
  echo "<?php header( 'Location: /index.html' ) ;  ?>" > build/index.php
  echo "{}" > build/composer.json
  git add --force build
  git commit -m 'Build for deploy'
  git push heroku $(git subtree split --prefix build deploy):refs/heads/master --force
  git checkout "${current_branch}"
  git branch -D deploy
}

main "$@"
```

The comments in the script mostly describe what is going on, but at a high level all we're doing is:
- Checking out a deploy branch
- Building the app
- Adding the `build` dir to `git`
- Force pushing the deploy branch's `build` to Heroku
- Cleaning up

It's not necessary to understand in order to use the script, but one of the more interesting parts of this script is the `git push` step which is utilizing `git subtree` in order to push the `build` directory to Heroku as the project's root. I don't completely understand what it's doing, but it's been working well for me :p.

Add the script to your project like so:

```sh
# in ./MyApp
mkdir bin
<user-whatever-method-to-put-script-at bin/deploy>
chmod +x ./bin/deploy
git add ./bin/deploy
git commit -m 'Add deploy script'
```

Once the deploy script is in place and made executable, deploying your app is as simple as running:

```sh
# in ./MyApp
./bin/deploy
```

Once deployed, you can open your app up in your browser via:

```sh
# in ./MyApp
heroku open
```

That's it!
