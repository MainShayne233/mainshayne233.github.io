Hello! My name is Shayne Tremblay.

I consider myself a programmer, technologist, and someone trying to be a good citizen.

I want to live in a world where software does more good than harm.

I enjoy fermented vegetables, rollerblading, communism, and many other things.

I'm excited about software architecture, programming languages, resilient systems, and kinda anything under the software sun.

Check out some things I've gotten to work on [here](https://mainshayne233.github.io/experiences/).
